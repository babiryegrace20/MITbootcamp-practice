# Day-5

Dear students,

Welcome to week 2 of GSL! We'll learn a few new
things this week like Git while continuing to focus,
from a technical standpoint, on honing our Python
skills.

We realized last week that, in jumping right into
Python, the exercises were a bit more challenging
than we intended to make them. For this assignment,
we've provided a lot more resources to solve each
problem to try to help you develop your
problem-solving mindset.

Expectations:

- Please make sure you can *run* Python on your
laptop before starting the problems. It is very
important that you can run your code in addition to
writing it--this is how real developers would
work! Please ask if you need help.

- Please remove the raise NotImplementedError
when you begin a problem.

- Try each problem independently with your partner
for at least five minutes before asking for help.

- Don't spend long amounts of time stuck on the
same problem! Either ask for help or move on, but
make sure you keep moving.

- When you've finished a problem and think you
have the right solution, you should test it by
running test.py. Please ask if you need help.

Good luck!
